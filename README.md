# MSML Conference---Optimal-Transport-PINNs-A-Data-Efficient-Approach-to-High-Fidelity-Turbulence-Modeling


🚀 Overview
This repository presents a hybrid framework combining Optimal Transport-enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks (OT-PINNs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) to model high-Reynolds-number turbulence from noisy Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data.

Designed for research and educational purposes, this project demonstrates how interpretable, reduced-order models can be learned from partial and noisy turbulence data using physics-informed deep learning.

🧠 Features
🔁 Time-dependent PINNs: Learn velocity fields across multiple timesteps

🎯 Optimal Transport Loss: Alleviates training instability and spectral bias

🧩 SINDy Integration: Extract sparse, symbolic dynamics from the learned flow

⚡ CUDA-Enabled: Training accelerated with GPU support

🔧 Noisy Data Handling: Trained effectively on 5% corrupted velocity data

📊 Energy Spectrum Comparison: Validates learned models against DNS

📦 Modular Design: Easy to adapt for other PDE systems or flow data
